        <h2>Acceptance of These Terms</h2>
        <p>
          You (“Customer”) may place orders for Products through Irmitek (“we,” “our”) via our
          website. By placing an order, you consent to these Terms and Conditions of Sale and
          acknowledge that we will fulfill your orders according to these Terms. Any terms or
          conditions in an order or correspondence that conflict with these Terms shall be
          considered inapplicable unless explicitly agreed to by Irmitek.
        </p>

        <h2>Orders</h2>
        <p>
          All orders are subject to Irmitek's acceptance. Irmitek reserves the right to refuse or
          cancel any order, whether or not the order has been confirmed. Your receipt of an order
          confirmation does not constitute our acceptance of your order. If we cancel an order after
          you have been charged, we will promptly issue a refund for the charged amount.
        </p>

        <h2>Product Offering</h2>
        <p>
          All product descriptions and listings on our website are subject to change at any time
          without prior notice. We reserve the right to change or discontinue any product at our
          discretion. While we make every effort to display the colors and images of our products as
          accurately as possible, we cannot guarantee that the display of colors on your device will
          precisely match the actual product.
        </p>

        <h2>Price</h2>
        <p>
          All prices are subject to change at any time before an order is placed and accepted by
          Irmitek. Prices displayed on our website exclude taxes and shipping charges, which will be
          calculated and shown at checkout based on your location and the selected shipping method.
          Prices on the website may differ from those in retail stores, as these are independent of
          Irmitek. Irmitek also reserves the right to correct any pricing errors, whether caused by
          human error or technical malfunction.
        </p>

        <h2>Special Offers</h2>
        <p>
          From time to time, we may offer special promotions, including discounts, limited-time
          products, or free shipping. These promotions are available for a limited period and may be
          modified or discontinued at any time without notice.

          factors beyond our control. Irmitek cannot be held liable for delayed deliveries. In case
